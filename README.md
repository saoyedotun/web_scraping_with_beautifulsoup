# web_scraping_with_beautifulsoup
> This project was used to scrape [Project Management Central - Agile Project Manager vs. Scrum Master](https://www.projectmanagement.com/discussion-topic/183962/agile-project-manager-vs--scrum-master--).
It pretty much works for every pther threads, all you have to do is
 -  Inspect the element of the thread you want to scrape
 -  Copy the HTML: this was done because the tables were created from javascript dom
 - paste the copied html in the html_doc variable, and run using below code

## to run
```
python script.py
```
